# Quick Start Guide

## 30-Second Setup

### 1⃣ Build Backend
```bash
cd whiteboard-realtime
mvn clean package
```

### 2⃣ Run Server
```bash
java -jar target/realtime-whiteboard-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### 3⃣ Open Browser
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 5-Minute Demo

1. **Open 2 Tabs**: Same URL `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Tab 1**: Draw a line with your mouse
3. **Tab 2**: Watch it appear in real-time! 
4. **Tab 1**: Click "Undo" → stroke disappears on both tabs
5. **Tab 2**: Click "Redo" → stroke reappears

**Done!** You have realtime collaboration working!

## Change Board

Tab 2 → Enter Board ID: `board2` → Click "Join Board"
- Now isolated from Tab 1
- Can draw independently
- Try opening Tab 3 with `board2` to see sync!

## Customize Drawing

- **Color Picker**: Click colored circle in toolbar
- **Width Slider**: Adjust line thickness (1-20px)
- **Clear**: Remove your strokes only

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Port 8080 busy | Change in `application.properties` |
| Can't connect | Check server is running (`curl http://localhost:8080`) |
| No sync happening | Check browser console (F12) for errors |
| Undo not working | Draw at least 1 stroke first |

## Live Demo Tips

 Use 2 monitors if possible (better for demos)
 Draw slowly for audience to see strokes
 Use bright colors to make strokes visible
 Narrate each action: "Now I'm drawing on client A..."
 Test Undo/Redo separately to show isolation
