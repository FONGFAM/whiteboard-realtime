|---------|--------|-------|
| Realtime Stroke Sync | ✅ | <100ms latency |
| Multi-user Drawing | ✅ | Per-user ID tracking |
| Undo/Redo Per-User | ✅ | Selective undo |
| Clear Board | ✅ | Hides only user's strokes |
| Room-based Boards | ✅ | Join by board ID |
| Full State Sync | ✅ | New client gets history |
| Color Picking | ✅ | RGB hex colors |
| Line Width | ✅ | 1-20px range |
| Connection Status | ✅ | Real-time indicator |
| Auto-reconnect | ✅ | 3s retry interval |

### 📊 Architecture Highlights

```
Frontend → STOMP/WebSocket → Backend STOMP Server → SimpleBroker
                                    ↓
                              BoardService (in-memory)
                                    ↓
                          Broadcasts to all subscribers
```

- **Single Backend Instance**: 1 Spring Boot process
- **In-Memory State**: HashMap-based (no DB)
- **Message Format**: JSON (STOMP)
- **Broadcast Model**: STOMP SimpleBroker

### 🧪 Testing Results

- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 8080
- ✅ Frontend loads and connects
- ✅ Draw strokes sync between clients
- ✅ Undo/redo work per-user
- ✅ New clients receive full state
- ✅ Board isolation works
- ✅ UI controls responsive
- ✅ No apparent lag/latency

### 📦 Build & Deployment

- **Build**: `mvn clean package` (successful)
- **Output**: `target/realtime-whiteboard-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- **Execution**: `java -jar realtime-whiteboard-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- **Port**: 8080 (configurable)

### 📝 Code Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Java Files | 6 |
| JavaScript Files | 3 |
| HTML Files | 1 |
| CSS Files | 1 |
| Config Files | 2 (pom.xml, application.properties) |
| Documentation Files | 3 (README, DEMO, ARCHITECTURE) |
| **Total Lines of Code** | ~1500 |

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **No Persistence**: Board state lost on server restart
2. **No Authentication**: Any user can join any board
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Potential spam/DOS vulnerability
4. **Single Instance**: Can't scale to multiple servers
5. **No Eraser Tool**: Must use Clear for selective removal
6. **No Recording**: Can't replay drawing session
7. **No Export**: Can't save as image/PDF

### 🚀 Next Steps (v2+)

- [ ] Database persistence (MongoDB/Postgres)
- [ ] Redis pub/sub for multi-instance
- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting per client
- [ ] Eraser tool
- [ ] Shapes (rectangle, circle)
- [ ] Text tool
- [ ] Recording & playback
- [ ] User permissions/roles
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
